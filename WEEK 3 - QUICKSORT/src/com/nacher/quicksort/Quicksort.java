/**
 * Algorithms Part 1
 * Week 3 assignment
 * Sergio Nacher Fern√°ndez
 * 
 * The included file contains all of the integers between 1 and 10,000 (inclusive) in unsorted order (with no integer repeated).
 * The integer in the ith row of the file gives you the ith entry of an input array.
 * 
 * Your task is to compute the total number of comparisons used to sort the given input file by QuickSort. As you know,
 * the number of comparisons depends on which elements are chosen as pivots, so we'll ask you to explore three different
 * pivoting rules. You should not count comparisons one-by-one. Rather, when there is a recursive call on a subarray of
 * length m, you should simply add m-1 to your running total of comparisons. (This is because the pivot element will be
 * compared to each of the other m-1 elements in the subarray in this recursive call.) WARNING: The Partition subroutine
 * can be implemented in several different ways, and different implementations can give you differing numbers of
 * comparisons. For this problem, you should implement the Partition subroutine as it is described in the video lectures
 * (otherwise you might get the wrong answer).
 * 
 * 1st part: For the first part of the programming assignment, you should always use the first element of the array as
 * the pivot element.
 * 
 * 2nd part: Compute the number of comparisons (as in Problem 1), always using the final element of the given array as
 * the pivot element. Again, be sure to implement the Partition subroutine as it is described in the video lectures.
 * Recall from the lectures that, just before the main Partition subroutine, you should exchange the pivot element
 * (i.e., the last element) with the first element.
 * 
 * 3rd part: Compute the number of comparisons (as in Problem 1), using the "median-of-three" pivot rule. [This primary
 * motivation behind this rule is to do a little bit of extra work to get much better performance on input arrays that
 * are already sorted.] In more detail, you should choose the pivot as follows. Consider the first, middle, and final
 * elements of the given array. (If the array has odd length it should be clear what the "middle" element is; for an
 * array with even length 2k, use the kth element as the "middle" element. So for the array: 4 5 6 7, the "middle"
 * element is the second one ---- 5 and not 6!) Identify which of these three elements is the median (i.e., the one
 * whose value is in between the other two), and use this as your pivot. As discussed in the first and second parts of
 * this programming assignment, be sure to implement Partition as described in the video lectures (including exchanging
 * the pivot element with the first element just before the main Partition subroutine).
 * SUBTLE POINT: A careful analysis would keep track of the comparisons made in identifying the median of the three
 * elements. You should NOT do this. That is, as in the previous two problems, you should simply add m-1 to your running
 * total of comparisons every time you recurse on a subarray with length m.
